"""Sorting takes so long... but if we donâ€™t mind losing some data we can sort of sort much faster!

A sort of sorted list is a monotonically increasing list containing all elements of another list 
 that were originally in sorted order. That is, a sort of sorted list obtained from list 
 contains all 
 such that 
 for all 
.

Input
The first line of input contains a single integer 
, the length of the unsorted list (
). The next line contains 
 space separated integers 
 (
).

Output
Output a single line of space separated integers representing the sort of sorted list obtained from the given list 
.
